    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; color: #0033cc; text-align: center;">In these three collages, I wanted to create three different atmospheres that reflect certain parts of my mind, body and spirit. My mind is a place of refuge, creativity, and exploration, so I wanted it to feel very calm and steady, employing a more horizontal composition. I included books, CDs, records, and other physical forms of media. For my body, I wanted to work around the idea that the body is the only one that is tangible. I looked for photos that were old and showed decay, incorporate an element of femininity, and reference the mind and spirit collages. I wanted the spirit collage to be chaotic and energetic, representing violent mood swings and overwhelming emotion. I used a diagonal composition and bright vibrant colors. Although it stands out from the other two collages because of the color scheme, I think the vibrant colors was crucial for communicating the idea.
